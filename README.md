#**🧪 Assignment Content**
🔹 Exercise 1 – Molecular Representations

For selected compounds, different types of molecular representations were generated using RDKit, including:

Canonical SMILES

2D structural depictions

3D conformers

Molecular descriptors

🔹 Exercise 2 – Structural Isomers of Pentane (C₅H₁₂)

Identification of all structural isomers of pentane

Determination of their corresponding SMILES

Visualization of branching points

Isomers studied include:

n-Pentane

Isopentane (2-methylbutane)

Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane)

🔹 Exercise 3 – Privileged Structures in Drug Design

Three privileged scaffolds were selected and analyzed:

Flavonoid

Steroid

Indole

For each structure:

Chemical structure was drawn

SMARTS pattern was defined

Example bioactive compounds were identified

Substructures were highlighted using RDKit
